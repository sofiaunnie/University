### Question
Design a Java application for a university course management system using object-oriented concepts. Your application should include a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with users and demonstrate your understanding of inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and packages.
Classes and Inheritance:
1.	Create a base class named Person with attributes like name, age, and contact information.
2.	Derive two classes, Student and Professor, from the Person class. Add attributes specific to each class, such as student ID and office hours.
Abstract Classes:
3.	Design an abstract class named CourseMember that extends the Person class. It should have an abstract method participateInCourse().
Interfaces:
4.	Create an interface named GradingSystem with methods calculateGrade() and updateTranscript(). Both Student and Professor classes should implement this interface.
Packages:
5.	Organize your classes into packages. Use a package named university to contain the classes related to the course management system.
GUI:
6.	Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to:
o	Add new students and professors with details.
o	Create new courses with information such as course code, title, and professor.
o	Enroll students in courses and assign professors to courses.
o	Display information about students, professors, and courses.
o	Calculate and display grades for students.
o	Update student transcripts with grades.
Your design should showcase a structured and modular university course management system, making use of inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and packages for clarity and maintainability.
